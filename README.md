DBMS Project (Used Goods Recycle cum Inquiry Management System)

Students come to NITC from different corners of India , even from foreign as well. So, when they pass out from college , most of the time 
they can’t take all their belongings to home. As a result lots of wastage have generated. Sometimes they sell some things to some retailers , 
but it causes involvement of third person.
   Secondly  , when someone loses something or someone finds something in campus , they put all their queries on NITC mail. Although it’s  
important to the person who has found it and the person whose it is but it’s useless to all the others. So sometimes it’s hard to find 
important mails inside a inbox full of queries and all.
   So to prevent involvement of third person or wastage of goods to recycle the used belongings and to prevent unwanted inbox filler we 
are going to develop an application which deals with both of these problems.
   Here in this app in one side students can put their used product’s advertisement  and those who found someone’s belongings put their 
advertisement to find the owner. On the other hand those who want to buy used product in relatively low cost and those who has lost 
something  can come and search their needs.
